This code uses an MQ-135 gas sensor to measure CO₂ levels and an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. 
The readings are displayed on two LCD screens: one shows real-time CO₂ and distance values, while the other displays a final computed value of carbon footprint. 
The system continuously updates and prints data to the serial monitor for debugging. 
It also calculates an average of multiple readings for better accuracy. This setup can be used for air quality monitoring and environmental analysis
